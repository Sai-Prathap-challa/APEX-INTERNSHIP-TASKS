      <h2>🌍 A Glimpse of the Journey</h2>
      <p>
        It all began with a worn-out backpack, a second-hand camera, and a restless heart. I left my small town not looking for luxury, but for stories — the kind that unfold in misty sunrises, in bustling market chatter, in strangers who become lifelong memories. My journey took me across lands painted in every hue — golden deserts, sapphire coasts, emerald forests, and snow-covered peaks that glowed under the northern lights.
        <br><br>
        I walked through the narrow alleys of Istanbul where every turn smelled of coffee and history. I danced with street musicians in Spain, barefoot under the Andalusian moonlight. I rode camels in the Thar desert, laughed with monks in Ladakh, lost myself in Tokyo’s neon haze, and cried quietly while staring at the silent beauty of the Norwegian fjords.
        <br><br>
        I wasn’t just collecting miles, I was shedding layers. Each place didn’t just teach me geography — it taught me resilience, compassion, solitude, and how to be fully present. This diary holds not just the places I’ve been, but the man I’ve become through each one.
